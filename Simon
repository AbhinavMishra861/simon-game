The Simon Game is a classic memory-based game where the player must mimic an ever-growing sequence of colors and sounds. This project is a web-based implementation of the game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🚀 Features
Interactive UI with colorful buttons and sound feedback

Sequence generation that gets longer with each correct level

Real-time input validation and score tracking

Game-over detection with restart option

Fully responsive design — playable on both desktop and mobile

🧠 How to Play
The game will display a sequence of colors, starting with one.

Your goal is to click the buttons in the same order.

With each correct level, a new color will be added to the sequence.

If you press the wrong color, the game ends and resets.
